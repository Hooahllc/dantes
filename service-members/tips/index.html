                                            <li>Enroll for a definite reason that you can verbalize and outline on paper. Define solid goals: degree or knowledge needs, not frivolous purposes. Will the course or courses help advance your military career or academic goals?</li>
                                            <li>Obtain a clear, complete description of the course. Review the school catalog. Know exactly how your course fits into your degree plan. Ensure your home school will accept the course you are taking, and that the course will satisfy a definite degree requirement. Give your home school a copy of the description. Will the course fit where you need it?</li>
                                            <li>Consider enrolling with a friend. Study with a partner. Distance Learning students need a support group.</li>
                                            <li>If available, fully participate in discussions on your class site. Your virtual classmates and professor are very important to your academic success.</li>
                                            <li>Study in the same place for each study session. Choose an appropriate site. Apply yourself, and take a break when needed.</li>
                                            <li>Devise a reasonable study plan. Set aside time in your schedule to work on your course requirements.</li>
                                            <li>Check your plan against the course outline and study guide provided by the school. Ensure they both look realistic when balanced with your work schedule, family, and other obligations.</li>
                                            <li>Include milestones to be reached according to the course outline. Be reasonable. Set aside some time to reward yourself when those milestones are passed, not before!</li>
                                            <li>Include check points in your plan. Check your progress periodically. Be honest and serious.</li>
                                            <li>Students who execute their study plan are most likely to complete the course successfully.</li>
                                            <li>Tell someone you respect about your course. Discuss your course with that person occasionally. There is a difference between involvement and commitment.</li>
                                            <li>If necessary, determine who will administer your exams. If your Education Office can do this, make arrangements many weeks prior to your exam and coordinate with your school. Make sure you take your exam at the pre-arranged appointment time, as your Education Office may not be able to reschedule another exam time that meets your schedule.</li>
                                            <li>There are many sources of help while you study at a distance. The school is the most logical place to ask for help (consider your professor, school advisor, education counselor, on-base instructors, subject matter experts, or friends).</li>
                                            <li>Review feedback from instructors. Consider all graded or returned lessons. Review text materials to understand key concepts.</li>
                                            <li>Completing a distance learning course takes motivation and hard work. The good news is, once you have successfully completed a distance learning course, completing future courses will be much easier.</li>

                                            <li>Consider your life goal. Is this your final degree or are you after a later "big-name" school. What's in a school's name? Consider your strengths and skills.</li>
                                            <li>What is the total cost? Consider tuition and maintenance fees? Consider all yearly fees. Some "collection type" schools charge additional fees. Enroll when you are close to your target degree.</li>

                                            <li>Will "any school" suffice or is "name" important? If a BS or MS is your goal, what percentage of the graduates go on to higher degrees, and to which schools?</li>
                                            <li>Does the school accept ACE credit, prior learning, CLEP, and DSSTs? Must tests have been taken within a specified time, such as the last 10 years? Is there a limit on the kind or amount of testing credit?</li>
                                            <li>How is previous credit transferred? Are there fees for transfer? Is there a time limit on how recently the credit must have been earned? Are there unique rules for lower or upper-level credit transfer?</li>
                                            <li>Is the school a SOC or SOC network member? Does the school offer other ways that classes can be taken. Does it offer a contract for degree?</li>
                                            <li>What is the mode of delivery: pen and paper, video, audio, computer conferencing? Do you have the needed equipment?</li>
                                            <li>Is the degree completely external or is there an on-campus requirement? How many credits must you earn with the school? If there is an on-campus requirement, do your family and job commitments leave enough time to complete the degree? Are your family members and job supervisors supportive?</li>
                                            <li>Does the school's accreditation meet your needs? Will credit transfer where you need it later?</li>
                                            <li>When do you need your degree? How long will it take to finish? Getting an external degree is not easier than going to class with your friends; it's harder!</li>

                                            <li>Before you embark on a multi-year journey, make the school commit itself. Have the institution do a degree plan.</li>
